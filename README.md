# odin-recipes
This is the first assignment from the Foundations curriculum at The Odin Project. I created a dummy recipes website, which aimed at showcasing some of the HTML skills I was introduced to during these first lessons. Some of the things I used were: creating a boilerplate, using objects to create titles, paragraphs, images, ordered and unordered lists, links to websites, indentation, emphasis, etc.
